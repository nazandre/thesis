# PhD thesis: Simulation codes

Distributed Algorithms for Large-scale Robotic Ensembles: Centrality, Synchronization and Self-reconfiguration Centrality. In this thesis, we propose centrality-based leader election algorithms, a time synchronization protocol and a self-reconfiguration algorithm.

This repository contains the code uses to simulate our algorithm. We perform simulations using [the VisibleSim simulator](https://github.com/claytronics/visiblesi). Evaluations performed to obtained the results presented in the manuscript can be replayed.

The complete source code of our algorithms and the simulation environment can be found in the [centrality](centrality), [time synchronization](time-synchronization), [self-reconfiguration](self-reconfiguration) folders.
