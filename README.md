# PhD Thesis: Simulation Codes

Distributed Algorithms for Large-scale Robotic Ensembles: Centrality, Synchronization and Self-reconfiguration. This thesis is about distributed coordination in large-scale ensembles of modular robotic systems. More particularly, we propose centrality-based leader election algorithms, a time synchronization protocol and a self-reconfiguration algorithm.

This repository contains the code uses to simulate our algorithm. We performed simulations using [the VisibleSim simulator](https://github.com/claytronics/visiblesi). Evaluations that we performed to obtain the results presented in the manuscript can be replayed here.

The complete source code of our algorithms and the VisibleSim simulation environment can be found in the [centrality](centrality), [time synchronization](time-synchronization), [self-reconfiguration](self-reconfiguration) folders.
